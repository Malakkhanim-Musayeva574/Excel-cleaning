# Excel-cleaning
Cleaning messy Excel data and preparing it for analysis
Sales Analysis and Cleaning Project
About the project:
I took a raw sales dataset that was very messy and cleaned it up to create a functional dashboard. The main goal was to practice data cleaning and see the actual sales trends.
Steps I took:
Data Cleaning
This was the most important part of the work. I used TRIM to remove extra spaces and Find & Replace to fix inconsistent names. I also standardized all date formats and converted currency to USD. Finally, I removed duplicates to make sure the data is accurate.
Analysis
I used Pivot Tables to summarize the data by region and products. It helped me see which areas are performing best.
Dashboard
I built a dashboard with slicers and charts. I also removed gridlines and headings in Excel to make it look cleaner and more professional.
Project Preview: Asia is the top performing market,iPhone 15 and Airpods are the best-selling products.
Tools: Excel =Trim, Replace, Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers

## HR & Sales Performance Dashboard (`hr_analyst_project.xlsx`)

In this project, I have developed an interactive dashboard by merging human resources and sales data. The primary goal was to analyze departmental efficiency and compare revenue generation against salary costs.

### Key Features & Techniques Applied:
* **Salary Benchmarking:** Calculated the **Average of Salary** across departments and cities to identify financial distribution Overall average: **$2,475**.
* **Dynamic Pivot Tables & Charts:** Transformed raw data into insightful visualizations, including bar charts for sales and pie charts for departmental shares.
* **Interactive Slicers:** Implemented multi-connected Slicers for **Department** and **City**, allowing for synchronized, one-click data filtering.
* **Conditional Formatting:** Applied **Icon Sets** arrows to the sales figures to instantly highlight top-performing and underperforming regions.

### Key Insights from the Analysis:
* **Top Revenue Drivers:** The **Finance** and **IT** departments lead the company, each generating **15,000** in total sales.
* **High-Cost Departments:** **Finance** has the highest average salary at **$3,100**, indicating a concentration of high-level expertise.
* **Regional Leaders:** **Madrid** **8,000** and **Berlin** **7,000** are the strongest performing cities in terms of sales volume.
