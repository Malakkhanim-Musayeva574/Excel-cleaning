# Excel-cleaning
Cleaning messy Excel data and preparing it for analysis
Sales Analysis and Cleaning Project
About the project:
I took a raw sales dataset that was very messy and cleaned it up to create a functional dashboard. The main goal was to practice data cleaning and see the actual sales trends.
Steps I took:
Data Cleaning
This was the most important part of the work. I used TRIM to remove extra spaces and Find & Replace to fix inconsistent names. I also standardized all date formats and converted currency to USD. Finally, I removed duplicates to make sure the data is accurate.
Analysis
I used Pivot Tables to summarize the data by region and products. It helped me see which areas are performing best.
Dashboard
I built a dashboard with slicers and charts. I also removed gridlines and headings in Excel to make it look cleaner and more professional.
Project Preview: Asia is the top performing market,iPhone 15 and Airpods are the best-selling products.
Tools: Excel =Trim, Replace, Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers
